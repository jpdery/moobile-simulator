About
-----

This is a iOS simulator that you can use to view your websites on an iOS device.

Use
---

You can see this code in action here: http://shelfworthy.github.com/moobile-simulator/

All you need to do is click `open`  in the button bar and enter a full web address (include the http://).

Because we can't set the user agent of the iframe used to load the site, you might also want to use an iOS user agent.

Advantages over the xcode simulator
-----------------------------------

The xcode simulator is great for a lot of things, but it does have some downsides.

- it requires you to install xcode
- no web inspector
- slightly more difficult to reload the current page


How to build
------------

If you are working on the code, built the consolidated js file using the following command:

	./build Moobile-Simulator/* Core/* More/* Extras/* Class-Extras/* > js/moobile-simulator.js
